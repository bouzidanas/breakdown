- *clear bricks*
- *tear drips*
- *hot dogs*
- *deer piss*

What do these seemingly random things have in common? The characteristic they share is that they are all salty.

The punchline comes right after and goes 

> *"They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard."* 

Lupe could have just said this line and got the message across but he didnt. Instead, he chooses a more audacious 
route to simulaneously demonstrate how "hard" he goes (in his raps). 
Not to mention Lupe simultaneously starts the hunting scheme (dogs, deer, shotguns, hunt) which makes it even harder. 

In the end, you have something much more illustrative than just saying *"I go hard when I rap."* 

Lupe puts the "*proof in the* ***pudding***."`],

When demand for Lupe's music drops, Lupe reflects on what it is, in his music, that people can't face/handle. What is turning them away? 

Lupe Fiasco is a very lyrical rapper. He takes pride in challenging his listeners. In his song "Dumb it Down," he raps about how he refuses to dumb down his lyrics to make them more accessible to the masses.

Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor, later joined by John Deacon. They are known for songs such as "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "Killer Queen."

Given the lines preceding this one, we can assume that Lupe is talking about making poetry ie writing raps when he says "forge poetry."

Paraphrasing:

>a hundred words for the humming birds that like to listen in. And son rises when the beat drops and dies off when the beat stops.

Back to the three lines in question, Lupe creates poetry and then spits it/raps it to golden-haired persons who prefer to consume things that are watered down.
They dont like raps that have too much heat or bars that are too cold. Meaning, these golden-haired persons like watered down mediocrity.

Note that *"apple prison"* can be heard in two ways: as *"ample prison"* or as *"apple prison"*

With the latter, it can be a reference to three things:
1. Adam and Eve, the apple, the garden of eden (weakest connection)
2. The Apple ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, Macbook, etc.). Apple makes it hard for adopters to leave.
3. An apple box which is a box used to *"imprison"* apples or keep them contained.

In total, we have 3-4 potential meanings. 

With the last meaning, we have Lupe asking whether or not we are operating bodies (living bodies) with spirits inside (souls) that are stuck inside a apple box (wooden box).
This refers all the way back to when Lupe said *"Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?"* and *"buried/berried living"* in the beginning of the song.

Now you maybe skeptical about the "apple box" → "coffin" connection but remember when Lupe started the fruit scheme/motif? 
Lupe was using fruit imagery when he was talking about coffins and being buried alive! Lupe already prepared us to make this connection!

But wait, there is more! The next line starts with *"Chicken hackin'"*. So we have chicken eating after the apple box/coffin line. Remember what came after the *"buried/berried living"* line? 
> *"Then proceed with the pack feeding"*

Lupe is not just reinforcing/re-establishing the connection between fruits and coffins but also the progression to the next set of imagery.
